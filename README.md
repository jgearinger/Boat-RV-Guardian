# 🛟 Boat & RV Guardian

**Free, open-source monitoring that protects your boat or RV — even when you're miles away.**

A dead battery stops your bilge pump. A burst line on an unlimited city-water hookup can flood a cabin or sink a boat. A tripped shore-power pedestal quietly thaws your fridge. These failures are almost always *quiet* — they happen while you're asleep, at work, or three states away.

Boat & RV Guardian watches for them and acts. It turns affordable, off-the-shelf smart-home hardware — **LinkTap** valves and **Shelly** sensors — into a purpose-built safety system for vessels and rigs, and sends the alert straight to your phone. The core app is free and open-source. Your only required cost is the hardware you choose.

## Why it exists

Marine and RV monitoring has long meant proprietary hardware at marine prices, walled-garden apps, and a monthly bill just to keep watching your own boat. Meanwhile, the home-automation world has cheap, reliable, well-documented sensors that do the exact same jobs.

Guardian bridges that gap — and gives it away, so cost is never the reason a vessel or rig goes unprotected.

## What it protects

- **🌊 Automatic water shutoff** — LinkTap smart valves meter real-time flow and slam shut the instant usage runs past your limit, stopping a burst line before it floods.
- **🔋 12V & shore-power health** — Track house and starter banks plus AC shore power, so a dead battery never strands you — or your bilge pump.
- **🚨 Instant flood alarms** — Shelly Flood sensors fire straight to the cloud, delivering a push notification the second water is detected, wherever you are.
- **🏠 Local-first & private** — Aboard and off-grid, the app talks directly to your sensors with zero latency and no internet. Cloud mode takes over automatically when you leave.
- **💻 Runs everywhere** — Web dashboard, native macOS/Windows desktop apps, and Android.

## Who it's for

Liveaboards, weekend cruisers, full-time RVers, and weekend campers — anyone who leaves a vessel or rig unattended and would rather get a phone alert than a repair bill.

## Get started in three steps

1. **Pick your hardware.** Choose a kit or individual LinkTap and Shelly parts — each with an estimated price — on **[Supported Devices](https://boatrvguardian.com/devices)**.
2. **Get the app.** **[Launch the web dashboard](https://boatrvguardian.com/app/)** instantly in any browser, or **[download](https://github.com/jgearinger/Boat-RV-Guardian/releases)** a native app for macOS, Windows, or Android.
3. **Install & configure.** Mount the valve at the spigot, pair your sensors, and set your alerts using the **[Getting Started guide](https://boatrvguardian.com/getting-started)**.

## How it works

When you're on the same network as your hardware, the app uses a **local connection** for instant, internet-free control. When you're away, Shelly sensors fire webhooks to a **Cloudflare Worker**, which alerts you and can trigger an emergency shutoff through the LinkTap cloud API.

```
LOCAL (aboard)     Phone / Laptop  <->  LinkTap Gateway  <->  Smart Valve
                   Direct, zero-latency control. No internet required.

CLOUD (away)       Flood Sensor  ->  Cloudflare Worker  ->  Push Notification
                                                         +  Remote Valve Shutoff
```

## What it costs

The app is free — your only cost is hardware.

| System | Hardware | Est. cost |
| --- | --- | --- |
| City water control | LinkTap valve + Gateway | ~$135–160 |
| Flood / high water | Shelly Flood Gen4 | ~$30 each |
| 12V battery monitoring | Shelly Plus Uni + fused harness + enclosure | ~$45 |
| Shore power | Shelly PM Mini Gen3 | ~$25 |

A typical full build runs **~$265–290**. Estimates only — prices vary by region. Full list with buy links: **[Supported Devices](https://boatrvguardian.com/devices)**.

> Some advanced features may become optional paid add-ons in the future to help sustain the project. The core monitoring and protection will always be free.
